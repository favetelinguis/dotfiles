My $HOME managed by chezmoi.

* Setup Aeon from scratch
1. Run *distrobox enter*
2. Run *sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply favetelinguis*
3. Build and create the distrobox I want and enter the new box.
4. Run *gh auth login* select the SSH option.
5. Step two is setup with https might want to edit the project .git/config to be ssh once that is setup.
6. Now run whatever command from bb.ed in chezmoi root, for example install Doom Emacs.


* Rebuiling my devimage
1. Run *doom sync* in new image since often that says it need to rebuild packages when i recreate image.
